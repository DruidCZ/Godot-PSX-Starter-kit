Send your love to them and only them. I just made simple fps controller. Everything what you se is done by those outstanding individuals.

# HOW TO USE

## It is simple. Create new scene. And click on append (little chain icon) 
![Step1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12586015/127041142-b36da7f5-e839-4c60-8324-515acb07a088.png)

## Then go to folder post process and select PPstack scene
![Step2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12586015/127041382-6df1c1cd-185e-494a-a980-16af59042784.png)

## Keep clicking until you got to last viewport. Click on it and append your map scene to it. In my example you can find "map" in folder level/maps/test_map. If you want to be sure, open scene in level/maps/ready_maps to see how it should look. Now when you click on 2D view, you will see something like this.

Well, i hope i will see many PSX styled games now! Enjoy!
